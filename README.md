# use-to-be-deleted
This will use to-be-deleted as a submodule and we'll see what happens when we delete it.

So as expected when to-be-deleted was deleted gone, so be very careful
when using other peoples submodules. When they are deleted they are gone.

But there is a saving grace, if there is a "local" copy of the submodule
then you can recreate an empty github or other remote and just "git push"
the "local" copy and it will be recovered. So assuming a project is popular
with many "local" copies you can't really delete it.
